For this activity, submit your updated code and a document with some screenshots and explanation of what you enhanced as discussed in class (each screenshot should have a caption explaining what you are representing with the picture).

Your code must start & utilize the starter code. This code can and should be modified. You are allowed to use other freely available/open source 3rd party libraries if you prefer. You should not use any private/password protected github repository code from Internet searches (this should be your own work or your own modifications with the help of free versions of Generative AI).

You are allowed to work individually or in groups (max 3 students). Be sure to identify/select all team members on the GradeScope submission.

Starter code can be found here (install "pygame" for Python version 3.13.9 and earlier; "pygame-ce" for Python 3.14 and earlier):
